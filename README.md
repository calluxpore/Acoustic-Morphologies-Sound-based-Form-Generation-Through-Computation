# Acoustic-Morphologies-Sound-based-Form-Generation-Through-Computation

## Project Overview

"Acoustic Morphologies: Sound-based Form Generation Through Computation " is an interdisciplinary research project that blends auditory and visual experiences through computational design. Developed at OCAD University, this project focuses on transforming sound into visual forms using a suite of software tools including Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper, and various extensions. The aim is to bridge the gap in sensory integration within creative contexts by capturing live audio, processing it, and converting it into digital geometries which can be 3D Printed.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Ensure all required software and plugins are installed.
2. Open the provided .3dm file in rhinoceros 7 or later
3. Open the provided .gh file in grasshopper with Rhinoceros 7 or later.
4. Connect your microphone and begin the audio capture.
5. Experiment with the parameters to explore different visual outcomes.
6. Use the button 'Bake' function to finalize and export the geometry for 3D printing or other applications.

## Applications

This project can be used for:

1. Real-time and pre-rendered audio visualizations. (Install Mosquito Extension)
2. Educational purposes in understanding the relationship between sound and visual forms.
3. Creative explorations in art and design.

## Conclusion and Future Work

This project demonstrates the potential of computational design in creating tangible art forms from auditory experiences. Future developments may include more complex applications, interactive installations, and educational tools along with forms to sound research.
